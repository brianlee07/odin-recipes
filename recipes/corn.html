    <h3>Topping options:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter, sea salt, lemon or lime wedges, red pepper flakes</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Husk-on method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pull back the husks of the corn leaving them attached at the base. Remove the silks (as much as you can) and close the husks back over the corn cob. Soak the corn in a large pot of cold water for 10 minutes. This will prevent the husks from burning too much on the grill. Drain and pat dry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a grill to medium-high heat. Place the corn on the grill and cook, turning every 3 to 5 minutes, until all sides of the corn are cooked, about 15 minutes. Remove from the grill, tie back the husks and use them as a handle. Serve with desired toppings.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Husked method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Remove the corn husk and silks and preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Place the corn on the grill and cook, turning every 3 to 5 minutes, until all sides of the corn are cooked and light char marks form, about 15 minutes. Remove from the grill and serve with desired toppings.
