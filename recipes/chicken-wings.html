        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>10 chicken wings</li>
        <li> 2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li> ¼ cup butter</li>
        <li> ¼ cup hot sauce</li>
        <li> 1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 1 pinch garlic powder</li>
        <li> celery sticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Place chicken wings in a single layer in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle flour mixture over top and toss until wings are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Add about 1 inch oil to a deep, heavy skillet; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely.)</li>
        <li>While the oil is coming to temperature, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until butter is melted and mixture is thoroughly blended. Remove from the heat and reserve for serving.</li>
        <li>Fry coated wings in the hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they begin to crisp and turn brown. Maintain the oil temperature while cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove wings from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Transfer wings to a platter and drizzle hot sauce over top; or mix wings and hot sauce in a bowl until coated. Serve. </li>
    </ol>
